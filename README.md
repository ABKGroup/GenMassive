# GenMassive
The GenMassive repository contains the generation scripts for large-scale "Designs of Experiments" (DOEs) runs, which generates config files and runscripts of experiments to use for the open-source RTL-to-GDS flow of the [OpenROAD tool](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project).

The **genMassive.py** script can be placed under flow/util/ in the [OpenROAD-flow-scripts](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts) repository.

For brief instructions on how to use, refer to the following ppt slides [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xbp4KJl3Hzyj9CMTodseSRms1rxTeZyN/view?usp=sharing).
